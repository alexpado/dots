# Akio's ricing

Welcome to my ricing repository!

Please note that this repository exists only for me to keep my ricing in a safe place. **It is not meant to be used publicly.** Yet, I'll leave this repository public as it can be a source of inspiration for some.

*If you are feeling adventurous you can try to use it still.*

### Wallpaper

You can use the wallpaper freely, but it is **only for personal use**. If you use it in one of your rice, feel free to let me know :)

For info, this is my color scheme, heavily inspired by Adapta Nokto.
