# Akio's ricing

This repository exists mostly for me to keep my ricing somewhere and easily re-install it whenever I install an archlinux.

I'll probably never support other distros, but I can help you if you try to install it yourself.

It is highly recommended to clone this repository in `~/.ricing`. If you are not doing it, you are on your own!

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/alexpado/dots.git ~/.ricing
```

Then add `alias rice="~/.ricing/rice.sh"` into your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` and source it. You can now use my ricing script.
